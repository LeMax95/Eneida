# Eneida

## My firs project during front-end course. It's a website about egyptian religion, mainly focused on deities worshipped by Heliopolis. Those group is also known as Ennead(nine). I'm planning to add a separate description for each of them, as well as create an online shop where a customer can buy different assets related to those gods, such as clothes, jewerly and totems.
